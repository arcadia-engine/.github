# 🌀 Arcadia Engine

> A modular 2D game engine and development toolkit for building multiplayer, tile-based games inspired by Tibia, Ultima Online, and Diablo—reborn for the modern developer.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Arcadia Engine is a Java-powered platform designed to make building online RPGs and sandbox-style games both approachable and deeply extensible.  
It is being developed as both a **portfolio centerpiece** and a serious open-source engine project.

You can follow the roadmap, explore the modular repos, and track the journey from core systems to full multiplayer demos.
